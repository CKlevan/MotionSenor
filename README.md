# MotionSenor
Motion Sensing with Music

What our project is: Our project takes a Raspberry Pi that we connected with a breadboard and a motion sensor (connected to the raspberry pi through the breadboard)  and uses python to play the song Sh-Boom whenever the motion sensor detects motion
Goals of the project: Our goal was to create a working motion sensor that plays a fun song when it detects motion.
How it works: The Raspberry Pi powers the breadboard, which powers the motion sensor. The Raspberry Pi was used to code the python. The python code controls the motion sensor, whenever the motion sensor detects motion it will print “Motion detected” and then play the first 9 seconds of the Song Sh-Boom.
Algorithm used: The algorithm that was used was an if statement to reset the music every time. We used a while loop to detect the motion and to start the music.
Where a motion sensor could be applied to: Motion sensors have a lot of uses these days some modern day examples include the following:
Ring doorbells- whenever it detects motion going by it the camera starts a 20 second video.
Outdoor lights- A lot of outdoor lights have a motion sensor built in to turn on the lights whenever they detect motion. Whenever they detect motion while the lights are on the timer resets.
Sinks- Some bathroom sinks run on motion sensors
Paper towel dispensers.
Etc.
Why motion sensors are used: Motion sensors these days are mostly used for home security. They are now also put into vr body trackers, echo shows, and more. They are also used in Bathrooms to help reduce water use, and waste of paper towels. They are also used in homes and other buildings with lights to help reduce the cost of electricity.
